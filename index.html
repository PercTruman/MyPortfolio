                    <p>I am a recent graduate of The Flatiron School's software engineering program.  During my course of study, I have studied Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, as well as HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <h3>Projects</h3>
                    <p>Having been enrolled in their asynchronous Flex program, all of my projects were built solely by me.  Links to three of those projects can be found below. These projects were full-stack projects utilizing a React frontend, with a Rails API backend.</p>

                    <h3>Staying Active</h3>
                    <p>In addition to the coursework and its projects, I am currently building an inventory project for a friend, who runs a massive fireworks warehouse, with over a  million dollars in sales over the course of 3 weeks, here in North Texas.  Additionally, I am studying Typescript, as well as Python through Udemy.</p>

                <p>I'm an energized entrant into the world of software engineering, with a plan to begin my new career with enthusiasm, humility, and a ubiquitous sense of humor. I have been both challenged and surprised by my love for solving problems with computer code since I've begun my studies in both front- and back-end engineering. My instructors and mentors have been impressed by both the speed with which I pick up new concepts and languages, as well as by my ability to articulate my code in both prose, and through speaking about it in mock interview situations..</p>
                <p>I am also a husband and father, and I take those two roles very seriously.  I love to re-imagine the world through the eyes of my children, and it has helped me maintain a sense of curiousity about new things.  In my spare time, I can be found on the disc golf course or playing board games with friends and family.</p>
